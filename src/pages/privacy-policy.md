==============

Fennex Agency Blog (hereinafter known as “Provider,” “us” or “we”) currently owns and operates this Fennex Agency Blog website (the “Site”).  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.  
We are committed to protecting your privacy and committed to developing technology that gives you the most powerful and secure online experience.  
This privacy statement applies to all Provider-owned web sites and domains. This privacy statement covers personally identifiable information, anonymous data collection and aggregate reporting. Personally identifiable information is any information that is associated with your name or personal identity.

##### What we collect

When you browse our Site, you do so anonymously. We also use Site information collected on an ongoing aggregate basis as you and other users use the Site. We do log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of which part of our website you visit and how long you spend there. But, we do not link your IP address to any personal. Like many other commercial websites, the Provider website may use a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect information about how you use the site. Please go to “Use of Cookies” below for more information.  
We may also collect non-personal information, such as your occupation, zip code, area code, etc. so we may better understand our Site users to improve the services and products we offer.

##### How we use it

We may use personal information for internal business purposes, such as to reply to inquiries, handle complaints, provide operational notices, keep records up to date to notify you via periodic e-mails of technical service issues, specials, or other related product/service information.  
We may also use your personal information for the following purposes:  
• To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.  
• To deliver services that you request or purchase.  
• To help us create and publish content most relevant to you.  
• To alert you of product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services provided from Provider.  
• To provide feedback in an online survey.  
• To participate in promotional offers. Note: You will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire to not receive these offers by sending us an email request at contact us.  
• To request assistance or fill out support requests.

##### Who we share it with

We never sell or rent your personal information. Provider may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or in good faith to (a) comply with legal processes served on the site, or (b) protect the rights and property of Provider, or (c) where our records indicate fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of, or (d) where your communication suggests possible harm to others.  
Provider may transfer information about Users if Provider is acquired by or merged with another company. The provider is not responsible for notifying User of such changes. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of Provider for the purpose of performing service for Provider.  
We may also share any information, including personally identifiable information that you provide on the Site, with our affiliates, for purposes of sending you information about the programs of the Site or its Affiliated Entities and, occasionally, sending you advertising/promotional material.  
This Site may contain links to other sites that are not operated by Provider. Fennex Agency Blog is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites, including websites by affiliated entities. If you provide any personally identifiable information through any such third-party website, your transaction will occur on that third party’s website and not on this Site, and the personally identifiable information you provide will be collected by and controlled by the privacy policy of that third party.

##### Security of your Personal Information

Provider strictly protects the security of your personal information. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  
Your personal information is never shared outside the company without your permission, except under conditions explained above. Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.

##### Third Party Links

Our Site contains hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit or are collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk. For further information, please consult their privacy policies.

##### Use of Cookies

Our web sites are not setup to track, collect or distribute personal information other than as defined in this Privacy Policy. Our site does generate certain kinds of non-identifying site usage data, such as number of hits and visits to our sites. This information is used for internal purposes only. The statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.  
Provider Web sites use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Service, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Provider services or Web sites you visit.  
Our affiliates and/or advertisers may also use cookies on their websites (third-party sites), over which we have no control. Such cookies (if used) would be downloaded once you click on advertisements on our website.

##### Google Analytics

Our Site uses a tool called Google Analytics to collect information about use of this Site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we obtain from Google Analytics to improve this Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.  
Also, our Site uses Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and its features. That includes obtaining specific visitor cookie data, such as the source, medium and keyword used to visit our website. Google Analytics does not store any visitor specific data and we will not use visitor specific data in any way related to Google Analytics, Google Adwords, and Remarketing.  
We may use remarketing with Google Adwords and analytics to display content specific advertisements to visitors that have previously visited our Site when those visitors go to other websites that have the Google Display Network implemented.  
We, and other third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on visitor’s past visits to our website.  
We take our users’ privacy very seriously. We feel that certain personal information should always be kept private, so we’ve developed restrictions around the types of ads where we don’t allow remarketing. When creating remarketing lists, we can’t use any sensitive information about users. This includes information such as their financial status, sexual orientation, and other sensitive categories.  
Users can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers and opt out of customized Google Display Network ads by visiting the Ads Preferences Manager.  
Your access to and use of any DoubleClick or Google display ads data is subject to the applicable terms between you and Google.

##### Use by Children

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 years, except where authorized by a parent or legal guardian of that child. In the event we are notified or learn that personal information of a child under the age of 13 has been received without the required authorization, we will delete the personal information as soon as possible.

##### Your Consent

By using this Site you consent to the terms stated in this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Condition of Use.

##### Amendment

Provider may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice to you.  The top of this Privacy Policy will contain the “Last Updated” date of this Privacy Policy.  You are required to check this date for any changes before using the Site.  Any use by you of the Site shall be deemed to constitute agreement by you to the amended Privacy Policy.
