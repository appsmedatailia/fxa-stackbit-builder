<h3 id="techniques-you-will-learn-in-this-course">Techniques you will learn In this course</h3>

*   Generating niche market ideas.
*   Conducting market research.
*   Validating a profitable niche business.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Important Note:</span>

If you already have a product ready to sell, and not being in a niche market doesn't mean you won't succeed. 

But if you want to last in the business for a while you need to think about shifting to a niche market you can serve.

Before we talk about niche markets and niche products, you need to understand what a Market is and its characteristics.


<h3 id="what-is-a-market">What is a market?</h3>


If you do some web research, you can find multiple definitions of that. To keep things simple, we have selected for you a simple definition that relates to our context; doing business online by selling products and services on Amazon FBA.

 

A market is a group of people (customers and potential customers) with the same or similar needs.

For example, all the people who need to be equipped for their next outdoor vacation belong to the Outdoor Market.

 

Every market has customer members, grouped by segments, who define it. Where a segment is a group of customers (individuals, households, or organizations) who share many characteristics and have the same needs (problems to solve, a lifestyle, or a passion to live).

 

<h3 id="what-is-a-niche-market">What is a niche market?</h3>


 

Niche markets are subcategories of large markets. A niche represents one segment of the overall mainstream market on which you will center your efforts. Despite its small size, this segment has unique problems and needs that make it distinct.

For example, outdoor is such a vast market you can’t call it a niche. On the other hand, camping, hiking, climbing, cycling, and fishing are much more defined niche market examples. 

Family riverside Camping and Wild mountain camping are even more specific sub-niche market examples of the same Outdoor market. They concern different segments of people and need different equipment.

 

<h3 id="what-is-niche-market-research">What is Niche Market Research?</h3>


Niche Market Research is looking for profitable niches ideas with low competition; Then, select profitable products (niche products) that match the needs of the niche segment (the customer)

You want to find the niche needs you can help with, and introduce your niche customers to beneficial solutions that you sell to them via Amazon FBA.

 

<h4 id="why-do-you-need-to-do-niche-market-research">Why Do You Need To Do Niche Market Research?</h4>


Because, if you identify a profitable niche market business, you can address a group of consumers with a similar issue/need that can be solved with a small solution at first.

Also, to generate profits, you must appear on page one of Amazon search results for as many buying keywords as possible. As a result, you need to compete for page one, and to avoid a higher level of competition, target a niche or even a micro niche. 

 

<h3 id="the-niche-market-typologies">The Niche Market Typologies</h3>


It is possible to have niche products or niche audiences. The first ones come and go, while the second ones stay for a little longer. 

i.g. In the health vertical (large market), an example of a niche audience markets include, nicotine addicts, diabetics, and people with receding hairlines. 

There are many niche products corresponding to the niche audiences below such as nicotine patches, acne cures, and anti-hair loss wonder pills, among others.

 

<h3 id="the-niche-categories">The Niche Categories</h3>


Despite the enormous number of niches available, we can categorize them into three major groups:

 

<h4 id="passion-niches">Passion Niches</h4>


A niche where people are obsessed with (almost like a hobby taken to the next level).



*   Horse riding
*   Model trains
*   Paintball

 

<h4 id="lifestyle-niches">Lifestyle Niches</h4>


A domain that people identify with (what they would call themselves).



*   Running
*   Veganism
*   Parenting

 

<h4 id="problem-niches">Problem Niches</h4>


Specialized services or niche industries that offer direct solutions to particular problems.



*   Acne
*   Dating
*   Weight loss

 

<h3 id="the-ideal-niche-market-business">The Ideal Niche Market Business</h3>


You should select a niche filled with people with problems you may solve through your offer, one that is narrow and specialized. 

 

Ideally, the niche market you select is already your area of expertise.



*   you know the people. 
*   how they think, 
*   what they like.

 

Or, find a promising niche market and then master it through growing your marketing skills



*   You learn by practice
*   It’s important to stick with just one niche - there’s a lot to learn!

 

Identifying and solving the problems and pain points of passionate people is the idea.

 

<h3 id="how-to-find-profitable-niches">How to Find Profitable Niches</h3>

 **Niche Audience Brainstorming**

The aim of this step is to evaluate if the members of a particular niche are easily identifiable and accessible.

You need to identify those individuals who would share similar reasons for belonging to your niche. You want to answer the question: why do they buy?
