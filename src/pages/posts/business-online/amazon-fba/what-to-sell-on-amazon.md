<h2 id="the-importance-of-selling-the-right-product-on-amazon"><strong>The
Importance Of Selling The Right Product On Amazon</strong></h2>
<p>
When you sell a product on Amazon, it’s your responsibility to take care of
everything from sourcing the products to customer service.
</p>
<p>
Before you even start selling, you need to invest a minimum amount of money
getting your product idea from zero to be listed to sell on Amazon.
</p>
<p>
And because not all products are created equal, if you sell the wrong item, the
chances of losing your business are higher.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, it’s crucial to sell the right product on Amazon.
</p>
<p>
Also, competition is fierce on Amazon. Millions of sellers in Amazon sell a wide
variety of products, so it’s hard to know which ones will be profitable.
</p>
<p>
Amazon product research is a very essential step to spot the best selling
products on amazon and make sure that you have made the right decision.
</p>
<h2
id="what-is-the-strategy-to-find-a-great-product-to-sell-on-amazon"><strong>What
Is The Strategy To Find A Great Product To Sell On Amazon?</strong></h2>
<p>
To find the best products for an Amazon FBA business, you can use several
criteria.
</p>
<p>
Understanding what those criteria are and how they all work is key to success.
</p>
<p>
It can be hard to find a profitable product on Amazon if you don’t know the best
criteria. You must be able to identify what products have high-profit margins
and what products are selling well.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>The golden rule to keep in mind is: focus on products with low
competition and high demand.</em></strong>
</p>

</a>

<h2
id="characteristics-of-an-awesome-product-for-amazon-fba"><strong>Characteristics
Of An Awesome Product For Amazon FBA</strong></h2>
<p>
There are many questions you may ask yourself when it comes to choosing a
profitable product for your Amazon FBA business.
</p>
<p>
Is the product easy to sell? Is there a demand for the product? Does it have
good reviews? Will it be profitable? Etc...
</p>
<p>
In the next section, we will discuss the important criteria you need to check to
validate your product idea.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind, however, that products belong to markets, and different audiences
characterize every market.
</p>
<p>
As an example, if you are in the climbing equipment market, your target audience
may include young amateurs who are looking for the best price for entry-level
equipment.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can target more experienced climbers who are looking for
high-quality products but at higher prices.
</p>
<p>
<em>In other words, you must use the criteria below based on your target
market.</em>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is more effective to know the impact and importance of each
criterion rather than having a checklist and apply it the same way to each
product you come across.
</p>
<h2><strong>The Market Criteria</strong></h2>
<h3 id="seasonality-&-trending"><strong>Seasonality & Trending</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal items will only go on sale during that season.
<li>Trendy products are very competitive. Usually, they sell for a short time
before they disappear.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid seasonal and trending products.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Tip:</em>
</p>
<p>
Target products with recurring purchases. To scale your business and sustain it,
you need regular cash flow.
</p>
<h3 id="number-of-reviews"><strong>Number Of Reviews</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>A low number of reviews indicates that the product is either new to the
market or is not doing well.
<li>Hight number of reviews means the product is selling well. It’s also a sign
of how much competition you’ll face; popular products attract more sellers, i.e.
more competition.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Select a product with many reviews; avoid those with hundreds.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Tip:</em>
</p>
<p>
You may have a chance to move to the first page of search results if the top
products on page one for your main keywords do not have many reviews.
</p>
<h3 id="bsr-amazon-best-seller-rank"><strong>BSR (Amazon Best Seller
Rank)</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>BSR is an indicator of a product’s popularity and sales volume.
<li>The lower the BSR, the higher the sales and competition.
<li>A high BSR indicates low sales volume.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Target a medium BSRs (very specific to the amazon category)
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="price-range"><strong>Price Range</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The profit margin will be very low.
<li>Also, lower-priced items usually suggest a price war, and you don’t want to
be part of it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid products that have a cheap price tag.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="profit-margin"><strong>Profit Margin</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The higher the profit margin, the more likely it is to be profitable.
<li>Be aware of all the fees that will cut off your profit margin (FBA fees,
Marketing fees, and many others).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Target only high-profit margin items
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The Product Criteria</strong></h2>
<h3 id="size-&-weight"><strong>Size & Weight</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping costs from suppliers to Amazon warehouses will be less.
<li>Lighter products allow you to store more in the warehouse, making it easier
to sell more and lower storage costs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Products should fit within Amazon FBA’s standard size range.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="quality-&-usability"><strong>Quality & Usability</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>This means fewer returns and a good reputation for your product.
<li>Since you are responsible for customer service, you won’t be swamped with
requests.
<li>Also, Negative reviews from unhappy customers will lead to Amazon penalizing
your product.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The product must be of superior quality, not fragile, simple to use, and
does not require technical expertise.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trademark-&-uniqueness"><strong>Trademark & Uniqueness</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Trademark and copyright are a source of legal issues.
<li>Unique product with room for improvement has the potential to grow.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The product must be unique and have no trademark or brand associated with
it.
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="types-of-packaging"><strong>Types Of Packaging</strong></h3>
<p>
How does it impact?
</p>
<ul>
<li>Packaging is important and can make the product more appealing.
<li>Strong packaging will last through shipping and can endure the bumps and
bruises of the process.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do about it?
</p>
<ul>
<li>The package needs to be strong, not fragile, and well-designed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Tip:</em>
</p>
<p>
You need to check the Amazon reviews, which is an excellent way to gauge
consumer opinion about any product and understand its quality, attractiveness,
and how you can improve it, etc.

id="examples-of-great-items-to-sell-for-amazon-fba-business"><strong>Examples Of
Great Items To Sell For Amazon FBA Business</strong></h2>
<p>
No source can tell you what exactly are the best-selling categories on amazon.
Unless you’re the guy who knows the guy who works at Amazon to get you their
sales figures!
</p>
<p>
But! Google “Top Amazon Product Categories” and you will find dozens of articles
on this subject; fortunately, there are good sources to draw inspiration from.
</p>
<p>
The bottom line, you must be critical and analytical about any product you
encounter.
</p>
<p>
Use the criteria outlined above and you can be sure to validate your product
idea quickly and not waste your time and energy on the wrong products.
</p>
<p>
That said, there are a wide variety of categories that are suitable for selling
on Amazon. These include books, baby items, electronics, and kitchen
accessories.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The traditional print book may seem boring, but it continues to be a very
popular item to buy and sell on Amazon.
<li>As babies grow, they outgrow many items, so parents have to buy new ones
over and over again. Therefore, baby items are in high demand and can be sold
quickly.
<li>Everyone loves their gadgets, and luckily new ones are coming out all the
time. Therefore, electronic accessories are a great way to find profitable
products for Amazon.
<li>The kitchen is the center of activity in the home. Because people are more
conscious about what they eat, kitchen accessories are a perfect example to sell
on Amazon FBA.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All four categories above are vertical markets, meaning competition is very
fierce for new sellers. Is that to say you can’t enter it? Those are markets
with great demand and high-profit margins, so you should go after them.
</p>
<p>
That being said, you need to dig deeper into each market to find a sub-sub
category, which is your niche market, since there is a proven demand there, but
competition is low.
