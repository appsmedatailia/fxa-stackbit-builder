Hello and welcome!

Are you an Amazon seller looking for your following best seller product? Do you struggle to achieve the most critical part of your Amazon business? Or maybe you are a newbie to the Amazon FBA business and don’t know how to choose the best products to sell on Amazon?

Whatever your situation, you need to focus on product research if you’re in the Amazon selling business. Therefore, you need to use premium tools to save time & money.

In this article, we will do things differently from the traditional Amazon Jungle Scout review and Jungle Scout Alternatives review websites. 

You have probably read other Amazon Jungle Scout reviews, and you found all similar. They introduce the Jungle Scout Amazon tool and why you need Jungle Scout Web App. Then give you an Overview of Jungle Scout Amazon Features & Benefits. Finally, you get the Pros & Cons of Jungle Scout Web App and its best alternatives.

Our Amazon Jungle Scout review guide will differ from the rest, as we based it on our previous article on product research. This post will provide you with a comprehensive overview of Jungle Scout Web App and show you how to use it in finding a winning product for your Amazon business.

Okay, let’s do it!

In the sections below, we will explore the features you need for product research in Jungle Scout.

As we discussed in previous articles, how to do Amazon FBA business forms the foundation of our review.

You’ll learn how to do niche market research with Jungle Scout Tool, as well as product research.

If you’re new to this business, we recommend reading the previous articles.

<h2 id="niche-market-research">Niche Market Research</h2>

Here is a detailed guide on [How To Do Niche Market Research](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/profitable-niche-market-business/).

*   **Step 1: Niche Market Brainstorming**
*   **Step 2: Niche Audience Brainstorming**
*   **Step 3: Problem and Solution Brainstorming**
*   **Step 4: Keyword Validation**
*   **Step 5: Competition Analysis**

We can do the 5 steps of the first milestone via the **_[Product Opportunity Finder (Formerly Jungle Scout Niche Hunter)](https://junglescout.grsm.io/fennex-opportunity-finder)._**

The purpose of niche brainstorming is to identify underserved target audiences. And sell them the product that best meets their needs.

Since we operate in the Amazon Selling Business, our target audiences are customers shopping in the Amazon marketplace. It means we can research niches within Amazon categories and subcategories with high demand and low competition directly.

<h3 id="what-is-the-opportunity-finder">What is the Opportunity Finder?</h3>

Opportunity Finder provides countless opportunities that are in high demand and low competition when you plug in specific criteria. See how a keyword performs on the market, emerging trends, and competitive insights when you turn it into a market segment.

<img
    src="\images\jungle-scout\Opportunity Finder.webp"
    alt="Jungle Scout Opportunity Finder"/>
</a>
</p>

By filtering by one or more of the following, you can find product niches to sell in:

*   Average Monthly Units Sold: This is the number of total sales in this niche from month to month.
*   Competition: By using review counts and advertising costs, we identify whether a niche is competitive.
*   Average Monthly Price: This is the average price per listing in the niche.
*   Niche Score: The score is based on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best opportunity and 1 being the worst. Based on demand, competition, and quality of listings, the score is calculated.
*   Monthly Search Volume: How many times the keyword was searched in the last 30 days.
*   Brand Names: By filtering out top-selling brands, you will view the top private label products.
