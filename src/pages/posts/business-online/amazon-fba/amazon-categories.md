<p>
If you are interested in making money on Amazon, you need to understand how it
all works. One of the essential elements for Amazon sellers is to find the best
amazon categories for their products.
</p>
<p>
You can sell your products in a lot of different product categories on Amazon.
It is up to the amazon sellers to decide which amazon category is best for their
business.
</p>
<p>
To find the best-selling categories on amazon, we need to identify what people
are buying and why they are buying it. Keep in mind that the top amazon product
categories are the ones that have a high conversion rate.
</p>
<p>
There are several ways for amazon sellers to find top selling categories on
amazon. You can do market research to identify top-selling categories on amazon
(see our post about <a
href="https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/amazon-fba/niche-market-research-how-to-find-profitable-business/">niche
market research</a>). Or you want to start with finding products that sell well
on Amazon and have high reviews. Once you have that, it is time to find the best
amazon category for your product. (see our post about <a
href="https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/amazon-fba/product-research-how-to-find-profitable-products/">amazon
product research</a>).
</p>
<p>
One important thing to keep in mind is that there are gated and ungated
categories on amazon. Gated ones are amazon restricted categories where you need
amazon approval.

<h2 id="what-is-amazon-fba">What Is Amazon FBA?</h2>
<p>
Amazon FBA is an opportunity for anyone to make money selling on Amazon. It is a
way for Amazon sellers to have their products filled by Amazon and then ship
them to the customer. The criteria for selling on Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by
Amazon) are the same as when you sell on Amazon and manage and ship orders
yourself.
</p>
<p>
The major difference is that you are no longer responsible for the inventory and
the associated costs. It means the amazon sellers do not have to own or ship the
items themselves. Amazon fulfilled them on their behalf.
</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-amazon-fba">What Are The Advantages Of
Using Amazon FBA?</h2>
<p>
The Amazon sellers can focus on other aspects of the business, allowing them to
grow faster. Amazon FBA has many advantages includes lower inventory costs and
faster shipping.
</p>
<p>
A well-thought-out strategy is necessary for successfully selling on Amazon FBA.
It is a business that requires a lot of time and effort, and sellers need to
research their market before. With a well-thought-out strategy, almost any
seller can start earning quickly.
</p>
<p>
The advantages of going with FBA overselling on your website are that it is easy
to scale, and there are no upfront costs.
</p>
<h2 id="amazon-product-categories-and-niche-market-research">Amazon Product
Categories And Niche Market Research</h2>
<p>
For building an Amazon FBA business, your first step needs to be market research
because every amazon product category represents a market itself.
</p>
<p>
Large markets are very competitive. Therefore, to avoid a high level of
competition, sellers (especially newbies) need to look for niche markets that
are subs of a large (vertical or parent) market.
</p>
<p>
The main amazon product categories are large markets broken into niches. Niches
are sub-markets broken down into individual items.
</p>
<p>
For example, the category “Fishing” could be broken down into the following
categories:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bait, Fishing Rods, Fishing Lures, Fishing Reels
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These niches are further broken down into individual items such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bait: Coils, Crickets, Worms, Hooks, Plastic Bait
<li>Fishing Rods: Telescopic Rods, Pole, Reels
<li>Fishing Lures: Crickets, Hooks, Jigs, Live Fish
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-best-criteria-to-find-profitable-amazon-product-categories">The Best
Criteria To Find Profitable Amazon Product Categories</h2>
<p>
The best amazon product categories are those that have the highest profit margin
and low competition.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind the three criteria below when searching for good amazon product
categories for your amazon FBA business.
</p>
<p>
The suitable category has:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A real profit potential
<li>A high demand
<li>A low rate of competition
</li>
</ul>
<p>
An important thing to do when validating your amazon product category idea is to
understand the market stat. You need to know what your competitors are doing in
the same category.
</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-great-amazon-product-categories">How To Find Great Amazon
Product Categories?</h2>
<p>
There is no straightforward answer to this question! But there are a few things
you can do before deciding what category is right for you.
</p>
<p>
Choose a product category that will make your business profitable. You can not
just go to Amazon and start selling in the first product category you find.
</p>
<p>
It is essential to know the target audience with your product before you create
it. Look at your niche and consider other factors such as the number of
products, what the competition is like, and how much traffic the amazon product
category gets.
</p>
<h3>Brainstorm Amazon Product Categories List Ideas</h3>
<ol>
<li>Let's start with you. Do you have a passion, a lifestyle, are you struggling
to get something done, do you have a persistent problem or an unmet need?
<ul>
<li>List them all
</li>
</ul>
<li>Go to websites, directories, and social forums such as
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/US/s?k=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>
<li><a href="https://dmoz-odp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dmoz</a>
<li><a href="https://alltop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alltop</a>
<li><a
href="https://www.aliexpress.com/all-wholesale-products.html?spm=a2g0o.home.16005.1.650c2145PU7KLb"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aliexpress</a>
<li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/n/all-categories"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay</a>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Develop categories, subcategories, and sub-subcategories
<li>Write a list of niches that attract you; Factors you should consider:
<ul>
<li>A trending or evergreen topic that interests you
<li>Something you have or can gain expertise in
<li>Something that you are passionate about and motivated to research and write
about.
<li>Something you are good at
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="amazon-ungated-categories">Amazon Ungated Categories</h2>
<p>
Amazon’s FBA program is a great way to sell products on Amazon. It has its own
set of rules and guidelines that you must follow to be successful.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Gated Categories represent restricted amazon categories where sellers
need to be approved to sell their product within it.
</p>
<p>
You don’t want to lose your time doing all the work it needs to find a perfect
product only to figure out that you might not sell it because it falls into one
of amazon's restricted categories.
</p>
<p>
So before you validate your amazon category idea, check that it is not within
the amazon gated categories list. But keep in mind that amazon restricted
categories are low competition and you can ungate any of the amazon gated
categories with some additional work and time.
